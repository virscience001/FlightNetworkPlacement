I have also Included comments in the Code files which can be useful to understand the logic.

Problem 1:

The logic for this is bit tricky. Basic idea is to PUSH elements starting from zero to first number in the sequence.

If the second number in sequence is greater than maximum number that has been PUSHed so far then PUSH numbers from
maximum number to second number in sequence. Then POP the stack and we get second element of the sequence.

If it's less than previous element then directly POP and check if POPed number is same as current element. If they are
not same then Pattern is not achievable. Otherwise move on to next element in the sequence.

If the currently processed number is '9', which is maximum number of the sequence then empty the stack and after each POP operation check if the Pattern is achievable or not.


Problem 2:

For this one, I have used straight and simple logic. I have created circular linked list and then start moving from first kid to next kid while keeping the count for N. Eleminate kids and at last Only 1 kid will be the winner.
